# Standard Clojure Style in JavaScript

A library to format Clojure code according to Standard Clojure Style.

## Project Status (August 2024)

This project is under active development and I do not recommend using it for
your codebase at this time unless you are very adventurous. I will publish a
release to npm when the project is stable enough for Alpha usage.

## Project Background and Rationale

Please see [Issue #1] for an explanation of this project's genesis.

[Issue #1]:https://github.com/oakmac/standard-clojure-style-js/issues/1

## Command Line Usage

The `@chrisoakman/standard-clojure-style` npm package exposes a command-line
tool to help format your Clojure projects. You may wish to run this as a git
hook, via continuous integration, an editor integration, etc.

If you have Node.js installed on your system, you can try out Standard Clojure
Style with the `npx` command:

```sh
## NOTE: the "fix" command will change your files on disk!
## Please ensure a clean git working tree or new branch as necessary

# formats the file located at src/com/example/foo.clj
npx @chrisoakman/standard-clojure-style fix src/com/example/foo.clj

# formats all .clj, .cljs, .cljc, .edn files found in the src/ directory
# and subdirectories (ie: recursive)
npx @chrisoakman/standard-clojure-style fix src/
```

If you plan to use the library frequently you may wish to install it globally:

```sh
# Installs "standard-clj" globally onto your system via npm
npm install --global @chrisoakman/standard-clojure-style
```

#### Quick Reference

```sh
# use the "list" command to see which files standard-clj will analyze
standard-clj list src/

# use the "check" command to see which files need formatting
standard-clj check src-clj/ src-cljs/

## use the "fix" command to format files with Standard Clojure Style
standard-clj fix src/ test/ project.clj

## you can pass a glob pattern for more control over which files are formatted
standard-clj fix --include "src/**/*.{clj,cljs,cljc}"

## ignore files or folders with the --ignore flag
standard-clj fix --include "src/**/*.{clj,cljs,cljc}" --ignore "src/com/example/some_weird_file.clj"

## standard-clj will look for a .standard-clj.edn or .standard-clj.json file in the directory where
## the command is run from (likely the root directory for your project)
echo '{:include ["src-clj/**/*.clj" "src-cljs/**/*.cljs"]}' > .standard-clj.edn
standard-clj fix

## or pass a config file explicitly using the --config argument
standard-clj list --config /home/user1/my-project/my-standard-cfg.json
```

#### `list` command

Use `standard-clj list` to see which files will be effected by the `check` and
`fix` commands. This command is useful in order to test your `--include`
glob patterns or `.standard-clj.edn` config files.

```sh
# prints each filename that will be effected by the "check" and "fix" commands
standard-clj list src/

# output the same file list in various data formats
standard-clj list src/ --output json
standard-clj list src/ --output json-pretty
standard-clj list src/ --output edn
standard-clj list src/ --output edn-pretty
```

#### `check` command

Use `standard-clj check` to see if files are already formatted with Standard
Clojure Style. Useful for continuous integration. This command will **not** write
to any files on disk.

Returns exit code 0 if all files are already formatted, 1 otherwise.

```sh
# check to see if files are already formatted with Standard Clojure Style
standard-clj check src-clj/ src-cljs/ test/
```

#### `fix` command

Use `standard-clj fix` to format files according to Standard Clojure Style.
This command **will** write to files on disk, so please ensure a clean git
working tree or new branch as necessary. The changes made by this command
cannot be undone by this program.

Returns exit code 0 if all files have been formatted, 1 otherwise.

```sh
# format files according to Standard Clojure Style
standard-clj fix src/ test/ deps.edn
```

#### Which files will be formatted?

`standard-clj` accepts several ways to know which files to format:

* pass filenames directly as arguments
* pass directories directly as arguments
* pass a [glob pattern] with the `--include` option

```sh
# will fix:
# - dev/user.clj (single file argument)
# - project.clj (single file argument)
# - all .clj, .cljs, .cljc, .edn files in the src-clj/ directory and subdirectories (directory argument)
# - all .edn files in the resources/ directory and subdirectories (glob pattern argument)
standard-clj fix dev/user.clj project.clj src-clj/ test/ --include "resources/**/*.edn"
```

#### Other options

- `--config` or `-c` - pass a filepath of a config file to use for options to the `standard-clj` program.
- `--ignore` or `-ig` - exclude files from `list`, `check`, or `fix` commands. Accepts individual files or directories.
- `--include` or `-in` - include files for the `list`, `check`, or `fix` commands. Accepts a [glob pattern].
- `--log-level` or `-l` - specify a logging level
  - `"everything"` or `0` - prints everything to either stdout or stderr. This is the default.
  - `"ignore-already-formatted"` or `1`
    - For the `check` command, will only print files that need formatting.
    - For the `fix` command, will only print files that were formatted or have errors.
    - This option can be less noisy in your terminal if you have a project with many files and only
      want to see the ones that need formatting.
  - `"quiet"` or `5` - will not print anything to stdout or stderr for the `check` or `fix` commands

#### Options via config file

By default, `standard-clj` will look for a `.standard-clj.edn` or
`.standard-clj.json` file located in the directory where the command is run.
Most projects that use `standard-clj` regularly will want to commit this file
to their git repo for convenience.

```sh
# create a .standard-clj.edn file
echo '{:include ["src-clj/**/*.clj" "src-cljs/**/*.cljs"]}' > .standard-clj.edn

# run the "fix" command with options from that file
standard-clj fix
```

You can use the `--config` or `-c` flag to specify a different file location:

```sh
# run the "fix" command with options from ./my-config-file.edn
standard-clj fix --config ./my-config-file.edn
```

## Formatting Rules

- trim trailing whitespace (ie: `rtrim` every line)
- ensure a single newline character (`\n`) at the end of the file
- convert all tab characters to spaces (except tab characters inside of Strings)
- [cljfmt option] `:remove-surrounding-whitespace?` = true
- [cljfmt option] `:remove-trailing-whitespace?` = true
- [cljfmt option] `:insert-missing-whitespace?` = true
- [cljfmt option] `:remove-consecutive-blank-lines?` = true
- format and sort `ns` forms according to Stuart Sierra's [how to ns]
- indentation follows the guide from Niki Tonsky's [Better clojure formatting]
  - with the addition of [Rule 3](https://github.com/clj-commons/formatter/issues/9#issuecomment-446167649) as proposed by Shaun Lebron
- comments that contain the String `standard-clojure-style:ignore` cause the next form to be ignored by the formatter

## Things that Standard Clojure Style does NOT do

- no config options
  - all projects using Standard Clojure Style follow the same rules
- From cljfmt:
  > "It is not the goal of the project to provide a one-to-one mapping between a Clojure syntax tree and formatted text; rather the intent is to correct formatting errors with minimal changes to the existing structure of the text.
  > If you want format completely unstructured Clojure code, the [zprint project](https://github.com/kkinnear/zprint) may be more suitable.
- no enforced max line length
  - text editors have the ability to wrap lines if you desire
- vertical alignment of `let` forms and map literals are allowed
  - the choice is up to the author
  - [cljfmt option] `:remove-multiple-non-indenting-spaces?` = false
  - I have seen too many code examples where vertical alignment adds clarity
- no configuration or special rules for indentation
  - the rules from [Better clojure formatting] are simple, easy to learn, and produce consistent-looking code
  - 100% compatible with [Parinfer] users
  - avoids the complexity of the [cljfmt `:indents` option]
  - avoids the complexity of different rules for different forms (ie: no [semantic indentation])

## Coding Style

The coding style for this library is intentionally very simple in order to make
porting the algorithm to multiple languages easier. This is informed by my
experience porting [parinfer.js] to multiple languages ([parinfer-lua], [parinfer.py],
and others).

Here are some rules to follow:

* each line should be one simple statement
* do not use ternary operators
* do not use variadic functions
* no `for` loops, only use `while`
* do not use `++` or `--` operators (wrap with function calls)
* wrap all String and Array methods with function calls
* do not early return from functions

Note: this should not be considered a definitive list. I will add to this as I come across additional cases.

## Development

Make sure that either [Node.js] or [bun] are installed (both should work).

```sh
## run unit tests
bun test

## test a single file
bun run jest format.test.js

## lint JS
bun run lint
```

[Node.js]:https://nodejs.org/
[bun]:https://bun.sh/

## Notes / Misc

* ns order is:
  1. `:refer-clojure`
  1. `:require-macros`
  1. `:require`
  1. `:import`
* Note that [how to ns] does not include guidance for `:require-macros`
  * ClojureScript source ([1](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/blob/a53e163d9c495904389bd111665e93c4ff0c398e/src/main/cljs/cljs/pprint.cljs#L11), [2](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/blob/a53e163d9c495904389bd111665e93c4ff0c398e/src/main/cljs/cljs/repl.cljs#L10), [3](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/blob/a53e163d9c495904389bd111665e93c4ff0c398e/src/main/clojure/cljs/compiler.cljc#L12)) consistently places `:require-macros` above `:require`, so let's go with that
* reader conditionals are placed at the bottom of the relevant ns section
  * sorted alphabetically except for `:default` (if it exists), which is last

## TODO

- [ ] need to add additional cases for namespace maps (what is allowed?)
- [ ] PR upstream to Clojure-Sublimed the option map for Repeat (can remove Repeat1)
- [ ] chat with Nikita about what he wants to do about emoji length inside of Strings
- [ ] add a test case for every rule
